# Project Portfolio Page of Alan Low (alanlowzies)

## Overview
This page showcases my contributions to the development of WerkIt!, a team project (tP) in the CS2113T 
Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming module offered by the School of Computing, National University of 
Singapore.

### About the Project
WerkIt! is a command line interface (CLI) application written in Java hat allows users to create a weekly workout 
schedule for them to refer to and follow. More details about the project can be found in the following locations:
* [GitHub Repository](../../)
* [WerkIt! User Guide](../UserGuide.md)
* [WerkIt! Developer Guide](../DeveloperGuide.md)

## Summary of Contributions
### Code Contributed
A detailed report of my code contributions to the tP can be found in the [tP Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=alanlowzies&breakdown=true) 
hosted by the module coordinators of CS2113T.

A summary of my code contributions are as follows:
- Wrote most of the `FileManager` API, which allows WerkIt! to read and write application data
into text files stored on the user's local filesystem 
([[WIP] Developer Guide (DG)]()). 
- Implemented the functionality for users to create a new workout 
([User Guide (UG)](../UserGuide.md#create-a-workout-workout-new) | [DG](../DeveloperGuide.md#create-new-workout)).
- Implemented the HashMap data structure in the `WorkoutList` API to allow `PlanList` to reference
workouts created by the user ([DG](../DeveloperGuide.md#design-considerations-for-creating-a-new-workout)).
- Wrote the `LogHandler` API, which allows the various components in WerkIt! to log into a file
stored in the user's local filesystem.
- Wrote JUnit test cases for WerkIt! APIs including (but not limited to) `WorkoutCommand`, `FileManager`, `Parser`, etc.
- Created skeleton codes and packages for the project.
