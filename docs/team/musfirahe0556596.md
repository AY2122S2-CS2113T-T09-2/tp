# Project Portfolio Page of Musfirah Wani (musfirahe0556596)

## Overview
This page showcases my contributions to the development of WerkIt!, a team project (tP) in the CS2113T
Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming module offered by the School of Computing, National University of
Singapore.

### About the Project
WerkIt! is a command line interface (CLI) application written in Java that allows users to create a weekly workout
schedule for them to refer to and follow. More details about the project can be found in the following locations:
* [GitHub Repository](../../)
* [WerkIt! User Guide](../UserGuide.md)
* [WerkIt! Developer Guide](../DeveloperGuide.md)


### Summary of Contributions
### Code Contributed
A detailed report of my code contributions to the tP can be found in the [tP Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Musfirah&breakdown=true)
hosted by the module coordinators of CS2113T.

A summary of my code contributions are as follows:
- Implemented the `deleteWorkout()` method for workouts.
  This includes logging, assertions and handling exceptions in the method.
- Contributed to some parts of `WorkoutCommand.java`.
  The code for calling of the `WorkoutList#deleteWorkout()` method
  in the `WorkoutCommand` class was added.
- Contributed to some parts of the `UI` such as the
  `printDeleteWorkoutMessage()` and `printNewPlanCreatedMessage()` methods.
- Contributed to some code in exception-related files such as 
`InvalidCommandException` and mostly in `InvalidPlanException`.
- Contributed mostly to the creation of `Plan` related classes such as
`Plan`, `PlanCommand` and `PlanList`. For `PlanList`, contributed to small methods
and also the main plan features like the creation of plans (`createAndAddPlan()`)
and listing of all plans (`listAllPlan()`).
- Implemented the HashMap data structure in `PlanList` API, 
referenced from team member Alan's implementation.
- Wrote parts of the `Parser` API, mainly the `createPlanCommand()` method.
- Wrote JUnit test cases for WerkIt! APIs such as the
`PlanListTest`, `PlanCommandTest`, `ParserTest` and `WorkoutListTest`
- Wrote JavaDocs, assertions and logging for methods implemented.
