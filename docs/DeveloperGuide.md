### Create New Workout
In _WerkIt!_, a workout is defined as an exercise paired with a number that represents the number
of repetitions. For example, 20 repetitions of the Russian twist is considered a workout. 

### Search
![SearchUML](https://github.com/a1021492980/tp/blob/branch-DG1/docs/uml/diagram/SearchClassUML.png?raw=true)
<br>

When WerkIt is running, the `WerkIt` class will keep prompting the user to enter command through the
`WerkIt#startContinuousUserPrompt()` method. After the user has entered command, The `UI#getUserInput()` method in `UI`
class will catch the user input, and it will be sent to `Parser#parseUserInput(String userInput)` method to analyse the
user's command. If the user's command type is search, i.e. `search <userAction> <keywords>`, the
`Parser#parseUserInput(String userInput)` method will parse the 'search' base word and proceed to create search related
command using `Parser#createSearchCommand(String userInput)` method. This method will further evaluate the
`<userAction>` and call the constructor of `SearchCommand` class by passing relevant parameters related to search to the
constructor. If the `<userAction>` is null or incorrect, an InvalidCommandException will be thrown. If the `<keywords>`
is not specified, an InvalidCommandException will be thrown.

#### Search for exercise
Format: `search /exercise <keywords>`

The `Parser#createSearchCommand(String userInput)` method will further evaluate the user input
`/exercise` and call the constructor of `SearchCommand` class by passing relevant parameters related to search exercise
to the constructor. The created `SearchCommand` object is returned by the `Parser#createSearchCommand(String userInput)`
method to `Parser#parseUserInput(String userInput)` method, and finally returned by
`Parser#parseUserInput(String userInput)` method to `WerkIt#startContinuousUserPrompt()` method. The search command will
be executed in `WerkIt#startContinuousUserPrompt()`. And based on the `<keywords>` specified by the user, the output
will either be a list of matching exercises or 'Sorry, no matching exercise found' if the user has entered the command
correctly.

#### Search for plan
Format: `search /plan <keywords>`

The `Parser#createSearchCommand(String userInput)` method will further evaluate the user input
`/plan` and call the constructor of `SearchCommand` class by passing relevant parameters to the constructor.
The created `SearchCommand` object is returned by the `Parser#createSearchCommand(String userInput)`
method to `Parser#parseUserInput(String userInput)` method, and finally returned by
`Parser#parseUserInput(String userInput)` method to `WerkIt#startContinuousUserPrompt()` method. The search command will
be executed in `WerkIt#startContinuousUserPrompt()`. And based on the `<keywords>` specified by the user, the output
will either be a list of matching names of plan or 'Sorry, no matching plan found' if the user has entered the command
correctly.
